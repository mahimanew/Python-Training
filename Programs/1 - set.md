1. Declare a list variable and assign values to it with 5 elements.  
2. Perform the following tasks with this list:  
   - Print all the list items without using a for loop.  
   - Print the 3rd element from the list without using a for loop.  
   - Print all the list items using a for loop.  
   - Print the 3rd element from the list using a for loop.  
   - Modify the 4th element and print the list without using a for loop.  
   - Modify the 4th element and print the list using a for loop.  
   - Find the sum of the list without using a for loop.  
   - Find the average value of the list without using a for loop.  
   - Find the sum of the list using a for loop.  
   - Find the average value of the list using a for loop.  
   - Find the sum of even numbers using a for loop.  
   - Find the sum of odd numbers using a for loop.
```
  
```
3. Declare a tuple variable and assign values to it with 5 elements.  
4. Perform the following tasks with this tuple:  
   - Print all the tuple items without using a for loop.  
   - Print the 3rd element from the tuple without using a for loop.  
   - Print all the tuple items using a for loop.  
   - Print the 3rd element from the tuple using a for loop.  
   - Note: Tuples are immutable, so you cannot modify elements directly.  
   - Find the sum of the tuple without using a for loop.  
   - Find the average value of the tuple without using a for loop.  
   - Find the sum of the tuple using a for loop.  
   - Find the average value of the tuple using a for loop.  
   - Find the sum of even numbers using a for loop.  
   - Find the sum of odd numbers using a for loop.  
```


```
5. Declare a dictionary variable and assign it with 5 key-value pairs.  
6. Perform the following tasks with this dictionary:  
   - Print all the dictionary items without using a for loop.  
   - Print the value of the 3rd key without using a for loop (by directly referencing the key).  
   - Print all the dictionary items using a for loop.  
   - Print the value of the 3rd key using a for loop (by tracking the index).  
   - Modify the value of the 4th key and print the dictionary without using a for loop.  
   - Modify the value of the 4th key and print the dictionary using a for loop.  
   - Find the sum of all the values in the dictionary without using a for loop.  
   - Find the average of all the values in the dictionary without using a for loop.  
   - Find the sum of all the values in the dictionary using a for loop.  
   - Find the average of all the values in the dictionary using a for loop.  
   - Find the sum of even values in the dictionary using a for loop.  
   - Find the sum of odd values in the dictionary using a for loop.
