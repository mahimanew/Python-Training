### **1. Introduction to OOP**

In OOP, the code is organized into:
1. **Classes**: Blueprints or templates for creating objects.
2. **Objects**: Instances of classes, containing data (attributes) and methods (functions).

---

### **2. Key Concepts of OOP**

#### **2.1. Class and Object**
- A **class** defines a structure for objects. It encapsulates data for the object and functions to manipulate that data.
- An **object** is an instance of a class. It represents a specific implementation of the class.

#### **Syntax for Defining a Class:**
```python
class ClassName:
    # class attributes and methods
```

#### **Example of Class and Object:**
```python
class Person:
    # Constructor (__init__) to initialize object
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old."

# Creating an object (instance) of the class
person1 = Person("Alice", 25)
print(person1.greet())  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old.
```

In this example:
- `Person` is a class.
- `person1` is an object of the `Person` class.

---

### **3. Instance Variables and Methods**

#### **3.1. Instance Variables**
Instance variables are variables that are bound to the object. They are defined in the `__init__` method.

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, model, year):
        self.model = model  # instance variable
        self.year = year    # instance variable

car1 = Car("Toyota", 2021)
print(car1.model)  # Output: Toyota
```

#### **3.2. Instance Methods**
Methods are functions defined inside a class and are used to perform operations on the instance variables.

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
    
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

dog1 = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
print(dog1.bark())  # Output: Buddy says Woof!
```

---

### **4. Class Variables and Class Methods**

#### **4.1. Class Variables**
Class variables are shared among all instances of the class. They are defined outside the `__init__` method and are accessed using the class name or `self`.

```python
class BankAccount:
    interest_rate = 0.05  # class variable

    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance

    def apply_interest(self):
        self.balance += self.balance * BankAccount.interest_rate

account1 = BankAccount(1000)
account1.apply_interest()
print(account1.balance)  # Output: 1050.0
```

#### **4.2. Class Methods**
Class methods are functions that take the class itself as the first argument, which is typically referred to as `cls`. They are used to modify class variables or to create factory methods.

```python
class Vehicle:
    wheels = 4  # class variable

    @classmethod
    def set_wheels(cls, wheels):
        cls.wheels = wheels

    @classmethod
    def describe(cls):
        return f"A vehicle typically has {cls.wheels} wheels."

Vehicle.set_wheels(6)  # Modify the class variable
print(Vehicle.describe())  # Output: A vehicle typically has 6 wheels.
```

---

### **5. Inheritance**

Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class). This promotes code reuse.

#### **5.1. Syntax:**
```python
class ChildClass(ParentClass):
    # child class code
```

#### **5.2. Example of Inheritance:**
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")
    
class Dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")

dog = Dog()
dog.speak()  # Inherited from Animal
dog.bark()   # Defined in Dog
```

In this example:
- `Dog` inherits the `speak()` method from `Animal`.

---

### **6. Method Overriding**
Method overriding allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class.

#### **Example of Method Overriding:**
```python
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        return "Some generic sound"
    
class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Bark"

dog = Dog()
print(dog.sound())  # Output: Bark
```

Here, the `sound()` method is overridden in the `Dog` class to provide a more specific implementation.

---

### **7. Polymorphism**
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It also allows methods to be used in different ways depending on the object.

#### **Example of Polymorphism:**
```python
class Cat:
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow"

class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

def animal_sound(animal):
    return animal.speak()

cat = Cat()
dog = Dog()
print(animal_sound(cat))  # Output: Meow
print(animal_sound(dog))  # Output: Woof
```

In this case, both `Cat` and `Dog` classes have a `speak()` method, and polymorphism allows us to use the same function to call the method for different objects.

---

### **8. Encapsulation**

Encapsulation is the concept of hiding the internal details of a class and restricting access to its inner workings. This is done using private and public access modifiers.

- **Public attributes** can be accessed directly.
- **Private attributes** are meant to be accessed only within the class.

#### **8.1. Public and Private Attributes:**

```python
class Account:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance  # public attribute
        self.__pin = 1234  # private attribute

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.balance

    def __update_pin(self, new_pin):
        self.__pin = new_pin

account = Account(1000)
print(account.balance)  # Accessible
# print(account.__pin)   # Error: 'Account' object has no attribute '__pin'
```

#### **8.2. Using Property Decorators for Access Control:**
You can use `@property` to define getter and setter methods for controlling access to private attributes.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.__name = name

    @property
    def name(self):
        return self.__name
    
    @name.setter
    def name(self, new_name):
        if len(new_name) > 3:
            self.__name = new_name
        else:
            print("Name is too short.")

person = Person("John")
print(person.name)  # Output: John
person.name = "Jo"  # Output: Name is too short.
```

---

### **9. Special Methods (Magic Methods)**

Special methods (also known as magic or dunder methods) allow you to define how objects of your class behave in certain situations. They are called automatically by Python in specific circumstances.

#### **Common Special Methods:**
- `__init__(self)`: Constructor method for initializing objects.
- `__str__(self)`: Defines how the object is represented as a string.
- `__add__(self, other)`: Defines the behavior of the `+` operator.
- `__len__(self)`: Defines the behavior of the `len()` function.

#### **Example of `__str__` and `__add__`:**
```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Point({self.x}, {self.y})"
    
    def __add__(self, other):
        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

point1 = Point(2, 3)
point2 = Point(4, 5)
print(point1 + point2)  # Output: Point(6, 8)
```

### **10. Exercises for Day 11:**

1. **Basic:**
   - Create a `Person` class with attributes like `name` and `age` and a method `greet()` that introduces the person.
   - Create a `BankAccount` class with methods to deposit and withdraw money.

2. **Intermediate:**
   - Create a `Car` class with methods to start and stop the car. Add an attribute to track the car's fuel level.
   - Implement inheritance by creating a `Vehicle` class and a `Truck` subclass. Override the `describe` method to include information about the cargo capacity for the `Truck`.

3. **Advanced:**
   - Implement a class for a `Rectangle` that calculates its area and perimeter. Overload the `+` operator to combine two rectangles (add their areas).
